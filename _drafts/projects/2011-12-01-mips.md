This was the project of our Computer Architecture class. In this project we designed a CPU in Verilog that understands MIPS Instruction Set Architecture. We first wrote different parts of it like Register File, ALU, Control Unit and etc. then combined them with the data-path to create this CPU. It really helped us to understand how a computer really works and I really enjoyed it.
