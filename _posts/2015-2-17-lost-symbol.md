Finally finished it.![alt text]({{ site.url }}/files/posts_files/LostSymbol.jpg "The Lost Symbol's Cover")

It opened my eyes to numerous new thoughts.
At its final chapters, I had to pause and put the book down and think for a while,
then after awhile I may continue reading.
There was a part which I really liked, where Katherine was talking to Longdon
about how we humans have been created in the God's image:

  > We are creators, and yet we naively play the role of "the created."
  We see ourselves as helpless sheep buffeted around by the God who made us.
  We kneel like frightened children, begging for help, for forgiveness, for good luck.
  But once we realize that we are truly created in the Creator's image,
  we will start to understand that we, too, must be Creators.
  When we understand this fact, the doors will burst wide open for human potential.

[Dan Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown)'s books are really inspiring for me.
So far I've read [The Da Vinci Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code),
[Angels & Demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Demons) and
[The Lost Symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Symbol).

Next stop, [Inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dan_Brown_novel%29).:smiley:
