  Hello World!
</p>

## Hello World!

Welcome to my personal web-page.
My name is *Arash* and I was born in [*Kerman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman),
a historical and cultural city located in South-East of [*Iran*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran).
I am a M.Sc. student in Software Engineering at the
Department of CSE and IT of [*Shiraz University*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_University),
where I also received my B.Sc. in Software Engineering.

## Research Interest

My research interest relies on distributed systems or cloud computing
and its abstraction levels from top to bottom;
how to efficiently build a Software as a Service (SaaS) and
deploy it on a cloud provided platform (PaaS)
which is running on a virtualized machine (IaaS).
The usage of new multicore CPUs and modern GPUs as the infrastructure of cloud
and distributed computing and
NoSQL systems as the backbone of its big data computations.

Thanks for stopping by!
