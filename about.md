## Hello World!

My name is [*Arash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arash) (Persian: آرش)
and I was born in [*Kerman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman),
a historical and cultural city located in South-East of [*Iran*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran).
I am a M.Sc. student in Software Engineering at the
Department of CSE and IT of [*Shiraz University*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_University),
where I also received my B.Sc. in Software Engineering.

## Research Interest

My research interest relies on distributed systems or cloud computing
and its abstraction levels from top to bottom;
how to efficiently build a Software as a Service (SaaS) and
deploy it on a cloud provided platform (PaaS)
which is running on a virtualized machine (IaaS).
The usage of new multicore CPUs and modern GPUs as the infrastructure of cloud
and distributed computing and
NoSQL systems as the backbone of its big data computations.

## Current Research

My current research is a joint research project with the University of Toronto.
It's about a scheme, named ***BigKernel***, that provides pseudo-virtual memory
to GPU applications and is implemented using a 4-stage pipeline
with automated prefetching to
*(I)* optimize CPU-GPU communication and
*(II)* optimize GPU memory accesses.
It's based on a proposed compile-time system that takes a BigData application
as input and modifies it to automate the CPU-GPU data communications and
improve the overall performance of the application.
We are developing the compiler tool using the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) infrastructure.

## What I am proud to be a part of

Another thing I have been recently up to is translating
*“[Engineering SaaS](http://www.saasbook.info/)”* book written by
[Armando Fox](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/fox.html)
and [David Patterson](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/patterson.html)
into Persian.
This is officially supported by the writers and I’m doing this with
Dr. Ahmad Towhidi and Nima Towhidi.
I’m really excited about this.
You can find more information about it [here](http://www.saasbook.info/translations/ir).

You can access my résumé from the sidebar.

Thanks for stopping by!
