## Hello World!

My name is [*Arash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arash) (Persian: آرش)
(aka NEO), and I am from [*Iran*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran).
I am a PhD candidate at [*School of Computer and Communication Sciences*](http://ic.epfl.ch/),
[*EPFL*](http://www.epfl.ch/),
and a doctoral research assistant at [*PARSA lab*](http://parsa.epfl.ch)
under supervision of [Prof. Babak Falsafi](http://parsa.epfl.ch/~falsafi/).
I did my master's in Software Engineering at the
Department of CSE and IT of [*Shiraz University*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_University),
where I also received my B.Sc. in Software Engineering.

## Research Interest

I am broadly interested in the field of systems and
interdisciplinary systems problems found in modern, large-scale datacenters.
My current research revolves around efficiency and sustainability enhancement of
server systems for datacenters.
By characterizing modern server workloads and employing emerging memory subsystems,
I look for minimizing the energy footprint and maximizing the compute density of server systems
through specialization of various system components, and better system integration.

## What I am proud to be a part of

Another thing I have been recently up to is translating
*“[Engineering SaaS](http://www.saasbook.info/)”* book written by
[Armando Fox](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/fox.html)
and [David Patterson](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/patterson.html)
into Persian.
This is officially supported by the writers and I’m really excited about this.
You can find more information about it [here](http://www.saasbook.info/translations/ir).

You can access my CV from the sidebar.

Thanks for stopping by!
