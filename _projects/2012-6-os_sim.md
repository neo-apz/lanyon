A simple OS simulator written in Java which gets an XML file consisting a process list and the details of each process such as CPU usage time or different I/O usage times and the details of the system such as available memory and the algorithms to use for scheduling. The goal was to simulate how these process will be scheduled by a real OS and calculating waiting and usage times. It supports the following scheduling algorithms: First Come First Served, Lottery, MLFQ, Priority, Round-Robin, Shortest Process Next, Shortest Remaining Time First, HRRN. The program keeps a queue for different resources and schedules each queue with its algorithm. The project was marked as one of the best projects of the “Operating Systems” class.
