For the “Software Engineering II” class project,
we had to build a simple workflow management system in which a user can
design his own workflow with multiple steps and assign each step’s task to another user.
After the designing phase, the user can start the workflow and the system will
automatically follows the defined steps till the whole workflow finishes.
We used Ruby On Rails framework, RSpec (TDD) and Cucumber (BDD)
to build the whole system as a simple web application.
Our written system got the highest mark.
