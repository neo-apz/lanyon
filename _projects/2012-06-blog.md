A simple web application written mainly in PHP for managing multiple blogs.
After signing up, each user can create his own blog(s).
He can write posts and comment on his or other blogsâ€™ posts.
In this project my focus was on three-layer OOP (Model-View-Controller) and I used the
[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) framework.
