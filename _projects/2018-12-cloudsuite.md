[CloudSuite](http://cloudsuite.ch/) is a benchmark suite of cloud services.
The benchmarks are based on real-world software stacks and represent real-world setups.
It is one of the early benchmark suites that is representative of modern datacenter services
and is included in Googleâ€™s [PerfKit Benchmarker](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker).
It has become an industry standard and been used to drive the design of modern datacenter-oriented CPUs,
such as Cavium ThunderX. I have been in the core team responsible for the maintenance and the third release of CloudSuite,
which is a major enhancement over prior releases both in benchmarks and infrastructure.
