In this application each peer can add other peers to its peer list and then asks its peer list for a file name. Each peer then replies whether he has the file or not. If the file is available the asking peer will receive the file from others. For writing this application, I first wrote a general purpose P2P Framework in Java then I wrote a file sharing application on top of it which uses an UDP flooding feature for finding peers. It was the class project of “Computer Networks” class and was chosen as the best project and I personally really like this project.
