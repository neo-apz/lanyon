A file sharing application based on P2P networking.
Each peer keeps track of other peers and can add/remove peers to its peer list.
A peer can ask other peers for a file and then can receive the file from those that have the requested file.
For writing this application, I first wrote a general purpose P2P framework in Java,
then I wrote a file sharing application on top of it.
