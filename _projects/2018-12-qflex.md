The [QFlex](https://parsa-epfl.github.io/qflex/) project targets quick, accurate, and flexible simulation of multi-node computer systems proceeding along four fronts:
QEMU, a popular open-source full-system machine emulator, Flexus, a powerful and flexible simulation framework
that enables detailed cycle-accurate simulation, SMARTS, which applies rigorous statistical sampling theory to reduce the simulation time
while achieving high accuracy, and NS-3, a popular and flexible network simulation stack.
I have been a member of the Flexus maintenance team and the team responsible for its new version branded as QFlex.
