For this project we had to write a small OS that performs 3 or 4 small tasks and is bootable. It’s a small text based OS that can perform these jobs: Changing the color of the written text, clearing the screen, restarting itself and Outputting a help and about text. It’s written in 80x86 Assembly Language.
